# Handwriting Robot

The **Handwriting Robot** project is designed to generate handwritten text based on user input. It sends the text input to **caligrapher.ai** to generate a handwriting-style SVG, which is then processed and rendered as polylines. These polylines are sent to a **2D gantry system** (blot.hackclub.com) to physically write the text on paper.
